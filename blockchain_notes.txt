A blockchain is a distributed ledger maintained by a network of nodes.
Blocks contain transactions and are linked through cryptographic hashes.
Consensus mechanisms like proof of work and proof of stake secure the network.
Smart contracts automate agreements between parties with no intermediaries.
Interoperability between blockchains enables seamless asset transfers across networks.
